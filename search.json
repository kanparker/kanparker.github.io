It then enters into the analog input cable. There is a second switch which then connects it to the analog output cable. The analog output can be run with the pin still connected to the analog input at the same time. The analog input can not be run while connected to the analog output. In addition each of the pins can be accessed through a RF Connector or through test pads located before the analog output side."

Too much flour and the pizza burns in the oven, not enough and the dough does not slide off the peel. To find the answer to this dilemma varying amounts of flour were added to pizza dough and the effect on the dough’s ability to slide on a surface effectively was examined. Through this, an optimum ratio of semolina flour to pizza dough was determined in order to give pizza makers everywhere a reliable measurement of flour they could use to overcome friction without inducing burning.\nDownload Student Poster (PDF)"
