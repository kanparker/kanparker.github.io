    "text": "RESET-Failure Evaluation of HfO₂-Based Memristors at Cryogenic Temperatures\nSkills: Python (Programming Language) · C++ · Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Tester · Data Analysis\nAuthor: Kanoa Parker\nMentors: Rocco Febbo, Dr. Garrett Rose\n\nMemristors are two-terminal memory devices with programmable resistance, first theorized by Leon Chua in 1971 and fabricated by Hewlett-Packard in 2008. Recent advancements in manufacturing have made memristors more accessible. With the integration of CMOS, there are hopes of developing an in-memory computation system, particularly for environments requiring cryogenic operation, such as space or quantum computing systems.\nThis study investigates RESET failure in HfO₂-based memristors at cryogenic temperatures. RESET failure is defined as a destructive event in which the device becomes permanently stuck at a fixed resistance.\nUsing a B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer and a FormFactor PMC200 cryogenic probe station, the applied RESET voltage was progressively lowered at 70 K until failure occurred. This data was used to refine an existing Verilog-A model, updating it to account for cryogenic behavior. The enhanced model supports the design of more robust memory systems for low-temperature applications. Results predict a decrease in memristor resistance and an increase in power consumption at cryogenic temperatures.\nDownload Technical Report (PDF)\n\nProject Poster"

It then enters into the analog input cable. There is a second switch which then connects it to the analog output cable. The analog output can be run with the pin still connected to the analog input at the same time. The analog input can not be run while connected to the analog output. In addition each of the pins can be accessed through a RF Connector or through test pads located before the analog output side."

Too much flour and the pizza burns in the oven, not enough and the dough does not slide off the peel. To find the answer to this dilemma varying amounts of flour were added to pizza dough and the effect on the dough’s ability to slide on a surface effectively was examined. Through this, an optimum ratio of semolina flour to pizza dough was determined in order to give pizza makers everywhere a reliable measurement of flour they could use to overcome friction without inducing burning.\nDownload Student Poster (PDF)"

Various surface patterns and additive compositions were tested.\nWear tests were performed using the Pin-on-Disk method with a Universal Micro-Tribometer (UMT-2) against 52100 steel balls. The study compared the performance of alumina disks with and without a porcelain coating, evaluated the effects of incorporating porcelain powder into denture resin, and assessed patterned versus unpatterned surfaces.\nFindings were presented at the 2025 Annual STLE Meeting in Atlanta Georgia.
