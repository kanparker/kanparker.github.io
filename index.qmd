## About Me

I am a final year Electrical Engineering undergraduate at Harvey Mudd College, passionate about the **power efficiency of Integrated Circuits** and the development of **novel device architectures**. I am actively pursuing PhD opportunities, particularly at the **University of California, Berkeley**, to contribute to cutting-edge research in **signal processing and control theory**.

My core motivation stems from the critical energy gap facing modern computing, from power-intensive AI to data center demands. I believe that optimizing the power efficiency of Integrated Circuits is a highly effective approach to addressing this challenge. My academic and research experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in practical application and component-level development, fostering a **systems-level thinking mindset** to create functional and impactful products.

My goal is to develop reliable and power-efficient solutions that can scale sustainably, especially as AI and intelligent interfaces become more pervasive. I am particularly interested in working with faculty focused on power and energy.
