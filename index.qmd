## About Me

I am a senior in Electrical Engineering at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu), motivated by the principle of using thoughtful, informed systems design to address pressing systemic challenges. My core focus is the escalating energy demands of modern computation. Dedicated to creating **scalable and sustainable solutions**, my research centers on **Power Electronics and Integrated Circuit (IC) Design**, specifically developing efficient, reliable hardware architectures for AI and data centers.

My background spans the hardware stack: from analyzing **device physics** (characterizing memristors at 77K) to building **system-level power stages** (designing regenerative loads for HITL testing).

I am actively pursuing PhD opportunities to create scalable, **high-reliability hardware solutions** that bridge the gap between novel devices and practical energy systems, ultimately contributing to closing the energy gap without sacrificing environmental or societal well-being.
