## About Me

I am a final-year Electrical Engineering undergraduate at Harvey Mudd College, dedicated to addressing the energy crisis in modern computing. My research focuses on **Power Electronics** and **Integrated Circuit (IC) Design**, with a specific interest in developing efficient architectures for AI and data centers.

My background spans the hardware stack: from analyzing **device physics** (characterizing memristors at 77K) to building **system-level power stages** (designing regenerative loads for HITL testing). I am actively pursuing PhD opportunities to create scalable, high-reliability hardware solutions that bridge the gap between novel devices and practical energy systems.
