## Engineering Clinic Projects

*A signature program at Harvey Mudd, Engineering Clinic is a capstone project sponsored by industry, government, academic institutions, and non-profit foundations. Student teams function as professional consultants for a given project, managing real-world budgets and deliverables to design, build, and test field-ready systems for their clients, directly applying academic theory to professional engineering practice.
