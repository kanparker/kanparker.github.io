## Clinic Projects

### **Regenerative Load for HITL Test System**
*Senior Clinic Project | Exolambda (Current)*

*   Collaborating with a team to design and build a regenerative load for a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) test system, requiring a minimum of three variable loads at 48 V and 10 A capacity.
*   Heavily involved in the physical building and testing of regenerative aspects, utilizing buck and boost converters and grid-tie inverters to refine the overall architecture.
*   Coordinated with team members on variable load development, ensuring interface compatibility (connectors, test points).
*   Developed two distinct architecture setups: one feeding power back to AC mains via a grid-tie inverter, and another generating DC voltage back to the PSU.
*   Expanded systems-level design capabilities in an open-ended project environment.

### **Air Quality Sensor Communication Hardware Upgrade**
*Junior Clinic Project | UC Berkeley - Civil & Environmental Engineering (Advisor: Chelsea Preble)*

* Updated communication hardware for an existing air sensor system used to measure air quality around industrial areas of Oakland.
* Researched and identified suitable wireless communication protocols and hardware options to transmit sensor data to a web server.
* Considered numerous outside factors, including location constraints, community WiFi access, signal strength in industrial areas, and LoRaWAN gateway availability.
* Navigated significant system limitations imposed by battery efficiency, which constrained sampling and data transmission rates, impacting overall system operational life.
* Developed a "large system thinking" mindset, identifying factors beyond traditional electrical engineering to create a functional product for public good.
