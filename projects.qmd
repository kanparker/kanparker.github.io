## Engineering Clinic Projects

### **Regenerative Load for HITL Test System (Work in Progress - Fall 2025)**
Client: Exolambda

Students: ..., Kanoa Parker, ...

Advisor: ...

Project Liasons: ...

My Contributions:

*   Collaborating with a team to design and build a regenerative load for a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) test system, requiring a minimum of three variable loads at 48 V and 10 A capacity.
*   Heavily involved in the physical building and testing of regenerative aspects, utilizing buck and boost converters and grid-tie inverters to refine the overall architecture.
*   Coordinated with team members on variable load development, ensuring interface compatibility (connectors, test points).
*   Developed two distinct architecture setups: one feeding power back to AC mains via a grid-tie inverter, and another generating DC voltage back to the PSU.
*   Expanded systems-level design capabilities in an open-ended project environment.
