## Clinic Projects

### **Regenerative Load for HITL Test System**
*Senior Clinic Project | Exolambda (Current)*

*   Collaborating with a team to design and build a regenerative load for a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) test system, requiring a minimum of three variable loads at 48 V and 10 A capacity.
*   Heavily involved in the physical building and testing of regenerative aspects, utilizing buck and boost converters and grid-tie inverters to refine the overall architecture.
*   Coordinated with team members on variable load development, ensuring interface compatibility (connectors, test points).
*   Developed two distinct architecture setups: one feeding power back to AC mains via a grid-tie inverter, and another generating DC voltage back to the PSU.
*   Expanded systems-level design capabilities in an open-ended project environment.

### **Air Quality Sensor Communication Hardware Upgrade**
*Junior Clinic Project | UC Berkeley - Civil & Environmental Engineering (Advisor: Chelsea Preble)*

* Updated communication hardware for an existing air sensor system used to measure air quality around industrial areas of Oakland.
* Researched and identified suitable wireless communication protocols and hardware options to transmit sensor data to a web server.
* Considered numerous outside factors, including location constraints, community WiFi access, signal strength in industrial areas, and LoRaWAN gateway availability.
* Navigated significant system limitations imposed by battery efficiency, which constrained sampling and data transmission rates, impacting overall system operational life.
* Developed a "large system thinking" mindset, identifying factors beyond traditional electrical engineering to create a functional product for public good.

## Coursework & Personal Projects

### **Analog Operational Amplifier Design**

*Coursework: Analog Circuit Design (ENGR151)*

*(Collaborator: Slader Spoor)*

*   Designed and constructed a fully operational amplifier from discrete 2N3904 and 2N3906 BJTs, utilizing a suite of passive components (resistors, diodes, capacitors).
*   Integrated key subcircuits including a current mirror for biasing, an emitter follower for buffering, a Class AB output stage for high-fidelity signal delivery, and a common emitter with degeneration for stable gain.
*   Achieved critical design objectives: high-impedance differential inputs, low output impedance, and high DC gain, demonstrating proficiency in fundamental analog circuit design principles.

### **Microprocessor Systems Control & Integration**
*Coursework: Electronic and Microprocessor Systems (ENGR155)*

* Programmed an STM32L432KC Microcontroller to generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) waves for a speaker and interpret pulses from a motor encoder using interrupts.
* Integrated systems to read temperature from a DS1722 sensor and display results on an ESP8266 Webserver.

### **Digital Audio Effects Guitar Pedals**
*Final Project: Electronic and Microprocessor Systems (ENGR155) (Ongoing)*

* Developing guitar pedals to add audio effects (degradation chorus, reverb) using an external ADC, FPGA, and STM32 MCU in tandem.
