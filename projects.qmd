**Modification of Abrasiveness of SLA Components**\
Studied how resin formulation impacts the abrasive properties of 3D printed parts.

**SLA Additive Manufacturing Review**\
Reviewed the impact of resin formulations and surface patterning on abrasiveness.

**Optimization of Pizza Making**\
Investigated the tribological properties of flour-dough interfaces to optimize sliding and reduce burning.

## [**Engineering Clinic Projects**](engineering-clinic.qmd)

*Engineering Clinic is a signature year-long capstone project at Harvey Mudd, where student teams consult for industry/academic sponsors to design, build, and test real-world engineering systems. [More information](https://www.hmc.edu/clinic/)*

**Regenerative Load for HITL Test System (Work in Progress)**\
Collaborating with a team to design and build a regenerative load for a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) test system, requiring a minimum of three variable loads at 48 V and 10 A capacity.

**Redesign of Low-Cost Sensors used in Community-engaged Air Pollution Monitoring**\
Updated communication hardware for an existing air sensor system used to measure air quality around industrial areas of Oakland. Developed a "large system thinking" mindset, identifying factors beyond traditional electrical engineering.

## [**Coursework & Final Projects**](coursework.qmd)

**Digital Audio Effects Guitar Pedals**\
Developing guitar pedals to add audio effects (degradation chorus, reverb) using an external ADC, FPGA, and STM32 MCU in tandem.

**Analog Operational Amplifier Design**\
Designed and constructed a fully operational amplifier from discrete 2N3904 and 2N3906 BJTs, utilizing a suite of passive components.

**Electrocardiogram**\
Designed and built an electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of the heart, using an instrumentation amplifier and filters.

**Automatic Ball Feeder**\
Constructed a device that feeds baseballs periodically into a pitching machine, including a funnel, rail system, and motor control.

**Autonomous Underwater Vehicle**\
Developed an underwater robot to test various nose designs, utilizing modified pressure sensors as pitot tubes.

**Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle**\
Designed a robot capable of vertical movement in water, integrating pressure sensors and thermistors with PWM control.
