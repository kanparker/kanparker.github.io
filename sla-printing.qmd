This project explores how surface modifications—such as patterning and top-layer doping with ceramic or metal additives—impact the wear resistance, abrasiveness, and sliding friction of components fabricated via stereolithography (SLA)-based additive manufacturing. Disks were printed using a DLP resin printer with commercial ceramic and denture resin materials. Various surface patterns and additive compositions were tested.

Wear tests were performed using the Pin-on-Disk method with a Universal Micro-Tribometer (UMT-2) against 52100 steel balls. The study compared the performance of alumina disks with and without a porcelain coating, evaluated the effects of incorporating porcelain powder into denture resin, and assessed patterned versus unpatterned surfaces.

Findings were presented at the 2025 Annual STLE Meeting in Atlanta Georgia. The talk focused on the effects on wear resistance and friction that porcelain coatings had on alumina disks.
