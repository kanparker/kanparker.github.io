This page details my work as an Undergraduate Researcher mentored by Rocco Febbo and Dr. Garrett Rose, focusing on low-temperature memory design for quantum and neuromorphic computing applications. The project involved two main components: experimental evaluation of memristor failure at cryogenic temperatures and the design of a custom PCB ("Octopus PCB").

Memristors are two-terminal memory devices with programmable resistance, first theorized by Leon Chua in 1971 and fabricated by Hewlett-Packard in 2008. Recent advancements in manufacturing have made memristors more accessible. With the integration of CMOS, there are hopes of developing an in-memory computation system, particularly for environments requiring cryogenic operation, such as space or quantum computing systems.

This study investigates RESET failure in HfO₂-based memristors at cryogenic temperatures. RESET failure is defined as a destructive event in which the device becomes permanently stuck at a fixed resistance. 

Using a B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer and a FormFactor PMC200 cryogenic probe station, the applied RESET voltage was progressively lowered at 70 K until failure occurred. This data was used to refine an existing Verilog-A model, updating it to account for cryogenic behavior. The enhanced model supports the design of more robust memory systems for low-temperature applications. Results predict a decrease in memristor resistance and an increase in power consumption at cryogenic temperatures.

The main function of the PCB is to allow the user to connect two 25 Position D-Sub Male Cable to then be connected to Analog Input Pixie 6365 or a Analog Output Pixie 6738.

The input from the 25 D-Sub cable goes through a 100 ohm resistor which can be bypassed with a switch. It then enters into the analog input cable. There is a second switch which then connects it to the analog output cable. The analog output can be run with the pin still connected to the analog input at the same time. The analog input can not be run while connected to the analog output. In addition each of the pins can be accessed through a RF Connector or through test pads located before the analog output side.
