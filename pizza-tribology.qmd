Pizza makers have consistently faced a challenge when dusting pizza dough with flour. Too much flour and the pizza burns in the oven, not enough and the dough does not slide off the peel. To find the answer to this dilemma varying amounts of flour were added to pizza dough and the effect on the dough's ability to slide on a surface effectively was examined. Through this, an optimum ratio of semolina flour to pizza dough was determined in order to give pizza makers everywhere a reliable measurement of flour they could use to overcome friction without inducing burning.
